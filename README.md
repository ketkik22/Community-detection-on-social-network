# Community-detection-on-social-network


After studying and analyzing the existing community detection algorithms, in this project
I am proposing a new algorithm which is a combination of Divisive Hierarchical Clustering
and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. This experiment is based on the concept
of iteratively merging nodes into community using the edge betweenness. It is observed
that edge betweenness of edges residing within same community is much lesser
than that of belonging to different. Using this approach I will conduct an experiment
to find underlying structure of social network. After achieving this, I am aiming to compare
and contrast the new proposed algorithm with the existing algorithms and to analyze
the effects of this algorithm on the random graphs and real-world networks.
